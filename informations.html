        <h1>INFORMATIONS</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my site, where I've crafted essential tools to help your trading experience within Bee Swarm
            Simulator. As a Bee Swarm Simulator player myself, i find it very annoying to trade and i'm too lazy
            to make trade ads lol. That's why I've personally developed two powerful utilities: the Trading Visualizer
            and the Wishlist Maker.</p>
        <p>Let me introduce you to the Trading Visualizer It's a tool designed to materialize the process of trading.
        Allowing you to make previews of trades demands where you are exchanging in DMs with someone, it is similar to wishlist but since the old purpose
        of visualizer got deprecated i decided to keep it on the website with a different purpose.</p>
        <p>Simply put the stickers involved in the trade and it will display them in the UI helping you previewing your trades.</p>
        <p>But that's not all. I've also created the Wishlist Maker, a feature to help you track your desired items
            within the game. Whether you're aiming to acquire Beequips with special abilities or exclusive stickers, the
            Wishlist Maker allows you to compile a comprehensive list of your goals.</p>
        <p>This site provides tools to help you make profit/navigate trought the stickers trading meta.</p>
