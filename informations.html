        <p>Welcome to my site, where I've crafted essential tools to help your trading experience within Bee Swarm
            Simulator. As a Bee Swarm Simulator player myself, i find it very hard to know the values and i'm too lazy
            to make trade ads lol. That's why I've personally developed two powerful utilities: the Trading Calculator
            and the Wishlist Maker.</p>
        <p>Let me introduce you to the Trading Calculator. It's a tool designed to simplify the process of evaluating
            trades. With values ranging from 1 to 10, this calculator offers a fork of trade worthiness.</p>
        <h3>(VALUES ARE BASED ON THE DIFFICULTY OF ACQUIRING STICKERS, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS FOLLOW THE DEMANDS OF THE
            STICKERS WHEN TRADING)</h3>
        <p>Simply input the stickers involved in the trade, and it will provide an average rating, helping you checking
            if your trade is fair.</p>
        <p>But that's not all. I've also created the Wishlist Maker, a feature to help you track your desired items
            within the game. Whether you're aiming to acquire Beequips with special abilities or exclusive stickers, the
            Wishlist Maker allows you to compile a comprehensive list of your goals.</p>
        <p>This site provides tools to help you make profit/navigate trought the stickers trading meta.</p>
